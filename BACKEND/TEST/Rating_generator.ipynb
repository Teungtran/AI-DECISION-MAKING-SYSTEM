         "After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\\n\\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\\n\\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\\n\\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \\n\\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\\n\\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\\n\\nOh...but good food counts too. \\n\\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\\n\\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\\n\\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \\n\\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\\n\\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\\n\\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\\n\\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh."

Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\\n\\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\\n\\nHere's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\\n\\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\\n\\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \\n\\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\\n\\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! \\n\\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \\\"there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\\\" Well, that didn't happen.\\n\\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \\n\\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.\\n\\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\\n\\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone."

'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\\n\\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\\n\\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\\n\\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\\n\\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\\n\\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\\n\\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \\n\\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \\n\\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\\n\\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\\n\\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\\n\\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball.

They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)\\n-Cash only\\n-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack\\n-About those homefries: They're often undercooked.

The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.\\n\\nThe service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.\\n\\nThe inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.\\n\\nThe prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.\\n\\nSo in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means.

I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \\\"pies\\\". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \\\"they were out\\\". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once."

First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\\\" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \\n\\nWe also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \\\"steak\\\" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. \\n\\nI have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed.

The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company.  Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted.  There is a Latino man in his 20's working when you arrive.  In my mind, I imagine a tailor to be older, kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck (Textbook movie tailor), so I was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing.  He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.  He takes his business very seriously.  While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price.

         "Unfortunately, the frustration of being Dr. Goldberg's patient is a repeat of the experience I've had with so many other doctors in NYC -- good doctor, terrible staff.  It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars."

It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life."

         "I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money."

         "I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \\n\\nSecond, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!"

Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\n\\nBottom line, this place sucks.

         "After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\\n\\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\\n\\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\\n\\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \\n\\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\\n\\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\\n\\nOh...but good food counts too. \\n\\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\\n\\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\\n\\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \\n\\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\\n\\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\\n\\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\\n\\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh."

         "I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.\\n\\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\\n\\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\\n\\nHere's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\\n\\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\\n\\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \\n\\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\\n\\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! \\n\\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \\\"there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\\\" Well, that didn't happen.\\n\\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \\n\\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.\\n\\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\\n\\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone."

         "Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\\n\\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\\n\\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\\n\\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\\n\\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\\n\\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\\n\\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \\n\\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \\n\\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\\n\\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\\n\\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\\n\\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\\n\\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\\n\\nFrom what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen."

         "My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.\\n\\nThe food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.\\n\\nThe service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.\\n\\nThe inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.\\n\\nThe prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.\\n\\nSo in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's."

It is just a five minute drive to downtown. Location is in a business park area so it is quiet. \\n\\nThe rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator, sink, cabinets and two burners. There is no oven which I expected as the descriptions all state \\\"full kitchen\\\" so be aware of that. Also they do not keep the dishes, pots and pans, coffee makers, toasters or utensils in the rooms. If you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in. \\n\\nThe room was clean and well maintained. Cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable. The free wifi is usually fast. \\n\\nThe best part about this location was the staff. The people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile.  I would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it."

         "If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \\\"pies\\\". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \\\"they were out\\\". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once."

Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012.

Same lousy service. \\n\\nMy guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. \\n\\nI really really want this place to do better. We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes. \\n\\nGet it together, Murphy's ... er, I mean Sullivan's....er, I mean Paddy's or is it Riley's? ;  ).

         "Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\\\" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \\n\\nWe also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \\\"steak\\\" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. \\n\\nI have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again!"

         "Having certain businesses with skill sets in your local neighborhood is important.  I try to keep it as local as possible, so when I heard about a tailor in Carnegie I was intrigued.  The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company.  Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted.  There is a Latino man in his 20's working when you arrive.  In my mind, I imagine a tailor to be older, kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck (Textbook movie tailor), so I was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing.  He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.  He takes his business very seriously.  While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price.  Really nice guy, please go and support this business to keep him around town!"

Very comfortable, inviting place with a very homey feel to it; to the right of the counter there's some pretty cool art displayed on the wall, as well as bookshelves packed with many books to choose from if you want some good reading to go along with your coffee. The staff is fast, attentive, & as friendly as can be, & as far as the coffee? Not too sweet, not too rich, but a perfect balance of the two! Great selection, great prices, great staff, & just an overall awesome coffee shop! The flavor of the coffee alone is enough to keep you coming back for more, & the welcoming feel of the shop overall is just an added bonus! The only regret I have is that there isn't one a little closer to where we live, but it's honestly worth the minimal travel time. If you haven't tried Grouchy John's it's definitely worth your while to check it out & pay this coffee shop a visit!"

         "OUR ROOM WAS LEAKING WATER! We woke up @ 3am to the sound of water dripping on the floor. We called the front desk (took 5 minutes for someone to pick up) and the lady told us she will move us to another room. So we have to pack up all our stuff to move to another room. So where do we move at 3am in the morning, all the way to the end of the Tower.\\n\\nIt took us 5-6 minutes of walking just to reach it! And apparently the pyramid leaks water according to the bell boy that helped us move. They put us in a nice room (mold was on the ceiling, we were too tired to care), better then the one before but it was already 4 in the morning by the time we reached it and unpacked, and we were going to check out at 10 am.\\n\\nSo during check out, we ask the front desk if there is anything they can do for us, and this rude manager comes over who seems already mad at us for even asking such a thing. She yells \\\"we put you in a better room then the one you had before so in our view you have already been comp\\\". But we were only in there for 4 hours and that was to sleep, we would have been fine with the same room we had before. We didn't ask for a better room, just one that wasn't leaking water! She didn't want to hear it and said she can't do anything for us except comp us a free buffet, ROFL wow thats it?\\n\\nWe sold out and took it, we were hungry and tired. So we get to the register of the buffet and they couldn't find our comp! I was like WTF, COME ON! The lady behind the register took our names and room number down and we finally got in for free (or so I thought). So a half  week later, back at my house I noticed on my back account a $40 change from Luxor, I WAS LIKE WTF!?!? I called and they charged me for my buffet! \\n\\nI WILL NEVER STAY IN THE LUXOR AGAIN! DO NOT BOOK A ROOM WITH THE LUXOR YOU WILL REGRET IT!"

I have to believe that Eddie agrees with that cause he is very charming and engaging... he makes you laugh and smile, and well... just feel welcomed!!!\\n\\nThis place is fairly new but has a major following already. Once you go there you are hooked! The 1st time we went there it was so delicious that i wanted to go back the next day! (That never happens) Im telling you i dreamed about this place (the Danny handroll & Princess Deana roll to be exact) and when i called my brother to tell him how much i loved it (he told me about it) and that i wanted to go back the next day he said \\\"yeah, i understand, we went 3 days in a row when we found it\\\" which then kinda gave me the ok to go again the next day and not feel bad!! :) thanks bro! \\n\\nIf you dont want to go to the strip and you want some AMAZING susi-this is the place to go!

         "So this weekend my 2 cousins and I decided we wanted to get our hair and makeup done at Platinum Entourage. We made reservations for 6pm for three people, assuming that we were going to get our hair done @ 6pm and then proceed to makeup done. Well we come to find that there is only one makeup artist and we all get our hair and makeup done at different times.  Most companies I have gone to in Hollywood they normally will have enough staff members to fulfill the clients' need, and not try to \\\"flip-flop\\\" (that's what prick called it) everyone around because they only have one makeup artist. According to the prick, they just \\\"flip-flop\\\" everyone around regardless of the time you made your appointment, so if you made it at 6pm chances are you won't be seen till 6:45pm.  So not only was that the stupidest business model for a company to have if they specialize in doing hair and makeup but the customer service was garbage. They were sooooooo rude about the entire situation. The receptionist didn't want to take any responsibility for the mix up, and the other guy was a complete prick in the manner that he spoke to us. To make matters worse they screwed up on the type of appointments, and then accused us of calling and canceling one of the makeup appointments!!!! I agree mistakes happen ALL the time, at first I wasn't upset until the prick came over to speak to us.  The manner that they dealt with the entire situation was disgusting, unprofessional and ignorant. NOW I can't say anything about the makeup artist because well we didn't get anything done due to all the screw ups, however, my cousin got her hair done and well it was nothing impressive."

But the best part was that they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. This was awesome! We got to hang out in the casino and get drinks until our table was ready. Once we were seated we were shown the drink menu. The drinks all looked amazing. Unfortunately, I was the DD for the night. We ordered parmesan (sp?) truffle fries and they were AMAZING! No joke, the best fries I've ever had in my life. The burgers were absolutely delicious. They were cooked to perfection. I hardly ever order a burger medium, and get a burger medium. It's always too well done. But this was perfect. Two friends I was there with ordered their's medium rare and you could see that theirs were absolutely medium rare and noticeably different from my medium. My husband and I keep a list of our top 5 burger places (similar to 'the list' from Friends), and this place shot to the top. We also ordered the Oreo shake and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Sticky toffee pudding is one of my all time favorites, but it was not at all good here. The shake was good, but I wish they had a malt option. Still, the sub-par desserts weren't enough to detract from the 5 star rating. Also, the servers' outfits are absolutely hideous, truly the most unflattering ensemble I could imagine for a server, but that's my only real criticism, which is hardly relevant at all."

However, the breakfast cost more than $28 and was basically disgusting. The toast had the burnt parts scraped off. No joke! For $36 we got burnt toast and greasy eggs. The waiters had NO IDEA what they were doing or what they had. Every question I asked was met with an, \\\"I'm not sure,\\\" or the wrong answer. \\n\\nThe dinner, which cost us over $100, was mediocre at best. The highlight of our $30 steaks was the mashed potatoes, which didn't even come with it, we had to pay for it as a side. The waiter didn't know how much wine came in a wine glass. He guessed it was a 4oz pour. I'm having a $100 dinner, and your waiter doesn't know how big of a pour you have for your wine? Isn't that like training 101?

         "I stayed at the Wynn for four nights last week.  It was my first and last time staying at this hotel.  First off, it is a very beautiful and classy place with an awesome buffet.  However I think all this disguises the underlying problems this hotel has: convenience and a quiet night's stay.\\n\\nI go to Vegas often and have stayed at many different hotels on the strip including Encore.  Checking-in never took longer than 5 minutes at the other hotels except at the Wynn which took 40 minutes.  Yeah, ok it was busy but Vegas always is when there's a convention in town which is basically every day.\\n\\nThe first night what I thought was the TI pirate show turned out to be the window panes hitting each other because of the wind.  Keep in mind it was not that windy.  It was more so just breezy.  I was wondering why I was hearing such loud noise every couple minutes.  You would think for such a ritsy, expensive hotel this wouldn't happen, but it's definitely the case at the Wynn and from what I remember the Encore as well.  Not a big deal if you are out all night partying.  But when you gotta get up early the next morning because you are on a business trip it's not a good thing.\\n\\nWhen it came time for me to leave and check-out they don't even have the convenience of checking out on the TV.  Anyways, I needed a statement copy so I went to registration to check-out.  Another 20 minutes wasted.  While I was waiting in line I overheard one of the workers tell a guest who was checking out that he was 13 minutes past check-out time.  Common now!  How dare he even say that to a guest and on top of that it was because the F@#$king line moved so damn slow!\\n\\nWhen it was finally my turn to check-out they messed up on my bill.  Turns out they never took down my credit card information, which I provided them when I checked in and charged everything to the saved company corporate card on file.  I told them all charges needed to be on my own credit card due to my company's policy.  She didn't understand or know what to do so she had to grab a coworker to help her out who also didn't understand the situation.  This is understandable because how can a confused person properly tell another what the situation was without confusing her?\\n\\nAfter some time they finally fixed the problem and I was out of there.  Never to return again.  I don't know if the convenience of quick checking-in and out is due to there computer system or just incompetence.  I don't care for finding out.  All I know is I completely discourage people from staying at this hotel."

The waitress didn't speak English and we had questions about some menu items which were in Spanish. It took us awhile to order due to the language barrier [two dishes were described exactly the same in different sections w/different prices, and other issues] and her serving other tables. By that time, the place had totally cleared out, including the music. My son and his wife got their shrimp burro meals fairly fast, then quite awhile later when they were finished, my grandson got his bacon-wrapped shrimp [he wasn't hungry any more from eating chips, etc], and then 15-20 minutes later, I got my \\\"seafood stuffed fish\\\" [ I guess seafood means only \\\"shrimp\\\" and veggies on top]. It took over an hour for my fiancee to get his Zarande Ado Relleno [grilled whole fish w/veggies on top] and I had to request his side of tortillas that were to come with it. He had been sharing my food and eating lots of chips, salsa and ceviche because he was starving, so wasn't hungry any more. He took a couple of bites of his meal and packed it to go [as did my Grandson]--we had to leave because he gets up very early for work, and it was after 9:30. On a positive note, the salsa was one of the best I've ever had [would like to get the recipe], and that along with the chips and ceviche [nice perk], and Margaritas(!) saved us while waiting for our food. However, although servings were generous the seafood did not have much flavor, was overcooked and a disappointment after reading some of the glowing reviews. It was not the waitress's fault the food took so long and she comped us on a round of drinks while we waited for the last two plates. Otherwise, she was fairly attentive, but it was very frustrating trying to communicate with her, only speaking muy poquito Espanol and using hand gestures. She did apologize, and I was sorry it was a negative experience because we were there to \\\"celebrate\\\" a birthday."

         "Dear Papago,\\n\\nI love you.  And I love your orange blossom beer.  The pizza is pretty fabulous too.  And I live really far away so coming here is a special treat.  But you blew it last night.\\n\\nThe server warned us in advance that they were understaffed and thing might be a little slow. No problem.  We ordered beer and beer bites.  I actually wanted pizza but thought it would take too long.  The beer arrived pronto.  One hour later, no beer bites and we had to leave.  The table next to us were noshing happily on their appetizer AND pizza.  I considered starting a bar fight just to steal a slice.  The waiter was super nice but I did not for one second buy his line about the beer bites taking forever.  You can cook an entire pizza more quickly than little bites of dough?  Do I look stupid?  If you lost my order, say so rather than insulting my basic knowledge of chemistry.\\n\\nI will probably be back but I think we need some time apart. \\n\\nLove,\\nHungry Girl"

         "I've been here a few times and let me tell you it's been a great experience in every visit, one of my two favorite appetizers is the nachos with carne Asada and the chorizo with queso, I could just keep coming back for these two,along with a beer at their newly added bar which by the way the variety it's pretty awesome, they have all kinds of tequilas you just wanna try them all haha! I'm sure they won't have a problem with that!,they also have a patio with a mister system which I haven't personally been into just yet because I've been there during the winter but that's the one feature I'm looking forward to go to during the summer; over all I thing it's a great place  to go and enjoy a nice meal with familly or friends, I will definitely come back!!"

         "Gigi's has focused it's efforts on only the superficial.  Their marketing materials (signage, brochures, packaging, etc.) are slick and glossy.  That's appropriate for this type of business, but what about focusing on the core if what it's supposed to do --- making great cupcakes?  And having a wide selection from which to choose?\\n\\nOn the Sunday afternoon I stopped in, there where six cupcakes.  Not six varieties, but six ACTUAL cupcakes!  I can understand the need to avoid waste and shrinkage, but six???  They're made of flour and water!!!  How much can it cost to keep a variety on hand?\\n\\nIn terms of the product, the cake was just average and the frosting was too thick and sweet.  The good news?  It was pretty to look at and well-packaged."

         "This is my home course. I play here about 75 times a year. Recently they had a management change. For some reason  they forgot about the golfers who supported them when times were tough. The changes that they are making are great for the course. Just remember the local guys are the one replacing divots, spending money in the restaurant and making a effort to support you guys even when you burn the greens or the fairways on 13. If you keep up your changes, the locals we will find another place to play. Now with that being said the course is playing well. There has been some new ways of keeping the course in good condition. They are mowing early and raking the bunkers. This has helped them  become more consistent. The layout is fair for every golfer. There's not much trouble and even errant shots are forgiven by desert surrounds and lack of trees. Take your wedges because it is generally driver,short iron wedge type course. The front has a little water but bring your gas mask. All in all I would rate Rhodes a 5 out if 10. Worth at the most for 18 holes $30 to $45 a round. A great practice course at best. Lessons are great and are complementary for players club on Saturday with Alex (no longer with this course on the time it took to post this review)He is great with kids. Steer clear of Don or anyone who came from Tuscany. They are full of themselves. I am a resident of Rhodes Ranch and I am very disappointed with the last 4-6 months. Arnold Palmer would not be proud."

I always drove past this location and asked myself, \\\"Why have I NOT tried this place yet?\\\" \\n \\nWe stood in line waiting to order and there was this elderly women in front of us who obviously was trying her best to take an order being it was her first time too, the cashier lady immediately got frustrated and scold the lady to pick up the tone of her voice because she couldn't hear her order.  \\nIf that wasn't rude enough a drive thru asked for her assistants and she snapped at them telling them that she's occupied, \\\"Hold Up!\\\"\\n\\nThen it was my turn to order. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and did my best to order... I decided on a medium burger, and she rudely told me... \\\"you mean the beef medium burger?\\\" Long story short because I don't want to write an essay...\\n\\nIf she didn't love her job find a new one... or if she was having a bad day?

They have a free shuttle to and from the strip and the airport too. I would definitely stay here again. I only paid $210.00 from September 3rd to the 6th. Cristian, one of their staff members, was amazing. He was always on top of everything and always willing to help. I loved the fact that although their staff was young, they were always happy, smiling and willing to help. Excellent work guys."

People who have to transfer from international to domestic usually have to grab their luggage and take it themselves. So no room in the shuttles. It is too far to walk. Stupid ignorant cheap supervisors. I can only assume that all the big buses were taken. Do us a favor and do something about that."

         "Read the reviews and couldn't wait to try this place.. that was my first mistake, I should have waited a long LONG time ;)\\n\\nFirstly, the restaurant is located in a small strip mall with some funky parking.  Went in, was impressed with the cleanliness and it certainly smelled wonderful.  Hubby was hungry, so he ordered the chips and dip, 2 garlic rolls, and a large pizza.. I quickly changed it to a small pizza, and I'm doubly glad that I did.\\n\\nChips and dip arrived - hubby thought they were both fantastic.  I thought they were good, but hardly \\\"life altering\\\".  The chips are homemade, no salt on them, and fried until hard.  They're too thick to be called crispy.  The dip was called Ranch and it was all you tasted.. Ranch dressing.  If there were other seasonings in there, they were lost.\\n\\nThen the pizza arrived, and we reminded the guy about our garlic rolls.  He quickly returned with 2 foil wrapped rolls.  Hubby opened his and tasted it immediately.. then set it down and never picked it up again.  He said it was cold and boring, so I didn't open mine at all - not going to waste time on something that bad.\\n\\nThe pizza toppings were fresh and the crust was crispy.  Not thin, not thick, but sturdy.  However, the sauce had virtually no seasonings to it - a frozen pizza generally has more flavor than this did.  There was a shaker of oregano and another of garlic located with the shakers of pepper flakes and dried parmesan cheese.. once those were added, then it was okay.  I have serious issues with a pizza that has to be seasoned afterwards.. isn't that the cook's job?\\n\\nI had one slice, hubby had two.. and we tossed half the small pizza as not worth saving.\\n\\nOn a plus note, the fountain coke tasted great ;)"

He is consistently late and there were a  couple of instances where I had to take stuff back to be re-done. I've only gone because it is convenient to my location and reasonably priced. I will never go back though. The straw that broke the camels back for me was the most recent time when I had him alter two suits. We agreed on two weeks to complete the work. I came back in three and he hadn't even started. He told me the earliest he could do it was another week and then was late again. Seriously? How hard is this? I am now going to start a search for a more reliable place."

But otherwise, meh.\\n\\nWe had lunch here and it was unremarkable. A Greek salad and gyros sandwich were both without any standout features. French fries were obviously from a bag, frozen. Not worth the calories. The sandwich had too much lettuce and not enough onion on the gyros sandwich, so it was bland, and tomato diced, and on top, which made the sandwich unnecessarily messy.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and the dining room was bright, spacious and sunny - and the presence of a coffee bar is definitely a plus - but I won't be back."
